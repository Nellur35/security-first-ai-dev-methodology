# Phase 7 — Implementation

**Input:** Phase 6 `tasks.md`

## Task Progress

### Task 1: [Component name]
**Status:** [ ] Not started / [ ] In progress / [x] Complete
**Files modified:** [list]

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] [Criterion from tasks.md] — verified by [test name]
- [x] [Security gate] passes — maps to [threat_model.md risk]

**Pipeline result:** All gates pass

**Deviations from tasks.md:**
- [If any — what changed and why. If none, state "None."]

### Task 2: [Component name]
**Status:** [ ] Not started / [ ] In progress / [x] Complete
**Files modified:** [list]

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] [Criterion from tasks.md] — verified by [test name]
- [x] [Security gate] passes — maps to [threat_model.md risk]

**Pipeline result:** All gates pass

**Deviations from tasks.md:**
- [If any — what changed and why. If none, state "None."]

## Implementation Summary

**Total tasks:** [N]
**Completed:** [N]
**Pipeline status:** All gates passing

## Deviations Log

| Task | What Changed | Why | Impact on Downstream |
|------|-------------|-----|---------------------|
| [task ID] | [what deviated from tasks.md] | [reason] | [none / requires Phase X re-entry] |

## Gate Questions

- [ ] Do all acceptance criteria from tasks.md pass?
- [ ] Does the full pipeline pass — not locally, the full pipeline?
- [ ] Are deviations documented and downstream impacts assessed?
- [ ] Do any deviations require phase re-entry?
