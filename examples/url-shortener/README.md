# URL Shortener API -- Worked Example

Worked example showing actual Phase 1-5 outputs for a URL shortener API. These are the artifacts produced by the 15-minute Quick Start. Use them as a reference for what "done" looks like at each phase gate.

## Files

| File | Phase | What it shows |
|------|-------|---------------|
| `phase-1-problem.md` | Problem | A clear problem statement with gate answers |
| `phase-2-requirements.md` | Requirements | Functional, non-functional, exclusions, definition of done |
| `phase-3-architecture.md` | Architecture | Components, interfaces, testability, ASCII diagram |
| `phase-4-threat-model.md` | Threat Model | Trust boundaries, threat table, specific mitigations |
| `phase-5-cicd.md` | CI/CD | Pipeline config, gates mapped to threats, dummy product |

Each file is self-contained. Read them in order to see how each phase's output feeds the next.
